SublimeLinter-contrib-julialintserver
-------------------------------
This linter plugin for SublimeLinter provides an interface to Lint.jl lintserver. It will be used with files that have the “julia” syntax.

This plugin will launch and maintain a juila daemon subprocess running Lint.jl lintserver to avoid recompiling `Lint.jl` on every invocation.
When you exit sublime text the subprocess will kill itself.
The first time you lint the lintserver will have to compile and start up which usually takes about 30 seconds.

** IMPORTANT! **

Before this plugin will activate, you *must*
follow the installation instructions here:
